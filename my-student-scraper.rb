Your goal is to get a database that has all the student data (so say if we wanted to build a command line version of the student website we could use that database).
   
  So you need to create a table or something to store all the student's data.
   
  Each student will probably be a row, with columns for their attributes.
   
  Then you go to students.flatironschool.com and via nokogiri, find all the individual profile pages. Open each one of those (probably in a loop) and from the individual students page, scrape all their data.
   
  Once you have all the students, drop it into a database.
